				<h3><center>New Studio Equipment!</center></h3>
				<p>Grumpy Puppy Productions is a full-service record label. We handle all of our artists professional needs from recording to touring.
				Therefore, it's pretty exciting when something happens to make that service even better.  This week our recording studio got a major facelift!
				We were able to aquire a NEVE 8078 mixing board from a facility in California and ship it out here to be installed in our Studio-B. We also got
				some new microphones and two racks full of processors.  Our engineers are having a blast trying all this new stuff out.  We can't wait to hear
				how it sounds!  Y'all stay tuned!</p>
